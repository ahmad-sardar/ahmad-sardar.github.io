# Notes

Personal notes on mathematics and machine learning algorithms. This is a math first approach. Looking at ML from both statistical learning theory and probablistic perspectives.

## Mathematics

Mathematical foundations organized by domain. Each concept includes intuition, formal definitions, proofs, and worked examples.

## Machine Learning Algorithms  

Notes on machine learning algorithms from first principles. Each algorithm is approached through historical context, intuition, concrete examples, formal treatment, and maybe some current research directions.
