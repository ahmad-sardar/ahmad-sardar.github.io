# Introduction

Euclidean geometry provides the foundational spatial reasoning required for understanding machine learning algorithms. From understanding projections in high-dimensional spaces to grasping the geometry of optimization landscapes, the concepts covered here are essential prerequisites.

## Prerequisites for This Chapter
- Basic arithmetic
- Familiarity with coordinate systems
- Ability to visualize 2D and 3D objects
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Why This Matters for ML
Euclidean geometry underpins:

- **Linear Algebra**: Vector spaces as geometric objects
- **Optimization**: Gradient descent as moving in geometric space
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Projections and distances
- **Kernel Methods**: Distance-based similarity measures
- **Neural Networks**: Geometric interpretation of layers

# 1. Axioms and Postulates {#sec-axioms}

## 1.1 Motivation & Context

**Why do axioms exist?**

In the 3rd century BCE, Euclid sought to build all of geometry from a minimal set of self-evident truths. Rather than prove everything from nothing, he identified fundamental statements that:

1. Are intuitively obvious
2. Cannot be derived from simpler statements  
3. Are sufficient to build all geometric knowledge

This axiomatic approach became the model for all of mathematics and, later, for formal systems in computer science.

## 1.2 Intuitive Picture

Think of axioms as the "rules of the game" for geometry:

- **Point**: A location with no size (like a GPS coordinate)
- **Line**: The shortest path between two points (stretched string)
- **Plane**: A flat surface extending infinitely (tabletop extended forever)
- **Distance**: How far apart two points are (measuring tape)

## Visualization Aid
Imagine you're given a blank infinite canvas and basic tools (straightedge and compass). The axioms tell you what operations are allowed and what properties are guaranteed.

## 1.3 Precise Definitions

### Euclid's Five Postulates

**Postulate 1 (Line Postulate).**  
Given any two distinct points, there exists exactly one line passing through both points.

**Postulate 2 (Line Extension Postulate).**  
Any line segment can be extended indefinitely in both directions to form a line.

**Postulate 3 (Circle Postulate).**  
Given any point $C$ (center) and any positive distance $r$ (radius), there exists a circle with center $C$ and radius $r$.

**Postulate 4 (Right Angle Postulate).**  
All right angles are congruent (equal in measure).

**Postulate 5 (Parallel Postulate).**  
Given a line $\ell$ and a point $P$ not on $\ell$, there exists exactly one line through $P$ parallel to $\ell$.

## Historical Note
The parallel postulate (Postulate 5) seemed less "self-evident" than the others, leading to 2000 years of attempts to prove it from the other four. This ultimately led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries!

### Common Notions (Axioms)

**Axiom 1.** Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.  
If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$. (Transitivity)

**Axiom 2.** If equals are added to equals, the results are equal.  
If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$.

**Axiom 3.** If equals are subtracted from equals, the results are equal.  
If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a - c = b - d$.

**Axiom 4.** Things that coincide with one another are equal.  
(Congruent figures are equal in all measurements)

**Axiom 5.** The whole is greater than the part.  
If $B$ is a proper subset of $A$, then $|B| < |A|$.

## Summary

These foundational axioms form the basis for all classical Euclidean geometry.
